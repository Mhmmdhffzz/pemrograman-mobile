    <string name="DesNo1">A Sky God’s Spiritual Foundation. It was the greatest natural treasure in all of existence, but the sacrifices one must make to gain the approval of such an entity was unimaginable.
        Ryu is a genius amongst geniuses.
        He was born with the four Grand Ancestral Bloodlines. The Lightning Qilin. The Fire Dragon. The Ice Phoenix. The Fire Phoenix…
        He was blessed with an Ancestral Grade Bone Structure and Ancestral Grade Meridians. The Ice Jade Crystal Bones. The Chaotic Silk Meridians…
        He was bestowed the First Ranked Heavenly Pupils. The Mysteries of Heaven and Earth Pupils…

    <string name="DesNo2">The Third Dimension is collapsing. The Fourth Dimension is descending.
        First it seemed that only technology would evolve, but who knew the world itself could too? It wasn’t as simple as climate change or tectonic movement. No, the fundamental laws of physics that governed everything were changing.
        Leonel was fairly lucky. His family was decently well off, his father loved him enough to brew vomit inducing nutrient rich smoothies every morning, and this was both the day of the National Championship and his 521st confession to his dream girl, Aina. As his father always said, nothing was more important than respect and persistence.
        Unfortunately, everything changed that night. At the after party of ages, the world reached a saturation point and an apocalypse descended.
        Abilities awakened. Sub-Dimensional Zones opened. Invalids rampaged through the Earth like a virus
        Those who could evolve would have a slim chance for survival. Those who couldn’t would die.
